# Mauve Visualization in D3.js

An experimental replacement for the desktop Mauve software. This repo provides
tooling to process XMFA+fasta+gff3 datasets into convenient and fast web-based
visualizations.

It is currently a work-in-progress, it will not be a feature-for-feature
re-implementation of the original Mauve.
